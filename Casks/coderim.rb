  caveats <<~EOS
    CodeRim is ad-hoc signed and is not notarized by Apple. Homebrew verifies
    the downloaded archive against this Cask's SHA-256 checksum, but macOS will
    still block the first launch.

    After reviewing the release source and confirming this Cask installed it,
    remove quarantine from CodeRim only and open the app:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/CodeRim.app
      open /Applications/CodeRim.app
  EOS
end
